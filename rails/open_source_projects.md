## Open Source Projects
Contributing to open source projects is a great way to keep your skills sharp, learn that new technology you've always wanted to learn and get to work in a team just as you do at work. This is especially important if you are in the job market.

- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/) - A good starter and there are many ways to get your feet wet, including just updating documentation
- [WikiEduDashboard](https://github.com/WikiEducationFoundation/WikiEduDashboard) - Support WikiMedia Foundation's learning platform
- [FreeUKGenealogy](https://www.freeukgenealogy.org.uk/about/volunteer/tech-volunteering-opportunities/) - An open data organisation
