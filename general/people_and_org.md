## About
This stage of the interview will mostly involve behavioral questions and a culture fit assessment. The objective for the recruiter is to know you better, i.e your professional experience and personal interests. An interview goes two ways, so this is an opportunity for you to learn about the company and the role to see if this is a fit for you. At the end of this stage, you should have a strong sense that:

- You sold yourself well. You highlighted your best accomplishments and clearly demonstrated why you are a good fit for the role
- You have a clear understanding of what the role requires and how it fits into the company's strategy
- Your values and preferences for an ideal workplace are aligned with the company e.g work hours (especially for remote work), communication e.g asynchronous communication vs meetings, open door policy e.t.c
- You know the compensation to expect and other benefits that may interest you e.g upskilling and learning initiatives
