## About
The expectation here is to show experience and prowess in the programming language of your choice. You may be faced with Leetcode style interviews, or a take home where you are expected to complete a challenge in a few hours. In any case, your coding skills should be at their sharpest, so it's best to stay prepared by doing lots of practice.

For leetcode style questions, just grind and pray for the best during the interview. For take homes, there is almost always a 'catch' or key thing that they will be looking for. It may not be nefarious gotcha but something that could be easily missed. Typically it's things to do with scalability, security, etc. Try to spot it. Be sure to write tests and a comprehensive README explaining your solution, tradeoffs and constraints.

## Resources
### Leetcode style questions
You will need lots of practise to be sharp enough to complete such questions in an interview. You will have the additional cognitive load of interview anxiety, unfamiliar editing tools in some cases (especially FAANG) and explaining your thought process as you go. These resources are a great way to structure your learning especially if you have never done leetcode questions before.

### Mock interviews
Because the tech interview is probably the most anxiety inducing stage, practise is key. Do mock interviews, preferrably a few days before the interview after you feel that you have done enough prep. Utilise your community and have a few people prepare interview questions. Get candid feedback from them afterwards and work on your weak points.

If you want to go a notch higher, here are some resources where you can pay to get mock interviews. Some offer ex-FAANG interviewers with lots of experience, so ideally you should get very good feedback.

## Tips
### How to approach technical interviews
1. Understand the problem
    - You can take a minute or two to think about the solution. Communicate this to the interviewer.
2. Identify data structure(s) and algorithm(s) that would be suitable
3. Communicate
    - Ask clarifying questions eg if there are constraints
    - Visualising problem might help e.g diagrams
4. Solve
    - Communicate as you go and think out loud
    - Collaborate with the interviewer, listen for hints or pointers
5. Test for edge cases
6. Optimise
    - Check for faster algorithms
