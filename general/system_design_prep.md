## About
System design interviews are now a mainstay of tech interviews. It may be a formal system design interview where an entire session is dedicated to this or it could be informal/indirect as part of the technical interview. The expectation here is that you should understand how to design complex, distributed systems and show understanding of challenges and key considerations in building such systems.

For the big tech companies, this stage of the interview is quite formal and structured. You'll be asked a question like 'design Uber'. There is no right or wrong answer, but there are key things the interviewer is looking for. Even for smaller companies, there will be some form of assessment about your system design skills.

## Tips
At this stage, the interviewers are looking for:
- A broad, base-level understanding of system design fundamentals.
- Back-and-forth about problem constraints and parameters.
- Well-reasoned, qualified decisions based on engineering trade-offs.
- The unique direction your experience and decisions take them.
- A holistic view of a system and its users.
- Solutions should be anchored to users, not just technical details

The resources below can help you achieve this level of mastery.
